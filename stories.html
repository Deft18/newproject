			<h3>Machine Learning Explained</h3>
			<p><span id='ml'>Machine learning is behind chatbots and predictive text</span>, language translation apps, the shows Netflix suggests to you, and how your social media feeds are presented. It powers autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical conditions based on images.

		<h3>Understanding the confusion matrix</h3>
		<p>Let’s take the confusion matrix of the XGBoost model as an example. Look at the first row. The first row is for transactions whose actual fraud value in the test set is 0. As you can calculate, the fraud value of 56861 of them is 0.
		</p>
		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>As I said before, in this process we are going to evaluate our built models using the evaluation metrics provided by the scikit-learn package. Our main objective in this process is to find the best model for our given case. The evaluation metrics we are going to use are the accuracy score metric, f1 score metric, and finally the confusion matrix.
		</p>
		<h3>Accuracy score</h3>
		<p>Accuracy score is one of the most basic evaluation metrics which is widely used to evaluate classification models. The accuracy score is calculated simply by dividing the number of correct predictions made by the model by the total number of predictions made by the model (can be multiplied by 100 to transform the result into a percentage).
		</p>
		<h3> F1 Score</h3>
		<p>The F1 score or F-score is one of the most popular evaluation metrics used for evaluating classification models. It can be simply defined as the harmonic mean of the model’s precision and recall.
